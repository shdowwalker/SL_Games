                    <p class="subpara" onmouseover="mouseoveron(this)" onmouseout="mouseoverout(this)">The arimac lanka institute has so far managed to bring these historical events to the new generation through a computer game. The computer game Kanjayudha - The Legacy of Giants is based on the character of Nandimitra the giant. Nandimitra the giant is a hero from Sri Lanka.

                        So Arimac Institute has been conducting research for 5 years and started this operation. These people have made a great effort to introduce the computer game created in Sri Lanka to the people living in Sri Lanka.
                      
                        Although this game was created based on the most discussed characters in the history of Sri Lanka, it must be said that it does not include any true stories. The story based on the game never happened. It has been designed in such a way that it is suitable for a computer game by including the events that happened during the time of King Kavantissa. This game is a 3rd person action game.
                      
                        The person who plays this game has to play through one character. In other words, it is a role play game. This game has to go forward as an episode. This Kanjayudha game will be a new experience for many people. So get ready to enjoy this latest experience. 
                      
                      So if there are people who want to play this game, visit the web page from the link below.

It is the second game developed by Arimac Lanka, released five years after the development of its first, Canchayudha.[4] The game's budget was $18,000. According to its developer, it will have a multiplayer version for mobile, and will include in-app purchases.[1]

                        It was titled Nero to pay tribute to Sri Lankan Sniper hero Ranjith Premasiri Madalana, who was known as "Nero" in the Eelam war, in which he had 217 confirmed Tamil Tiger kills. Despite its name, the game does not include events from the war.</p>

In the 1st war, Insurgents lost so many people. Since DWB used Advanced Robotics they kept pushing the SOA army back to their mainland. After countless losses, SOA wanted to expand its Trifuel mining operations so they ally with other factions. They call it Trifuel Alliance. Agents from all over the world were assigned to the extraction site to protect the harvester from any threat. DWB counter-attacked by cloning these agents and their abilities. DWB used them against the original agents who were assigned to protect the harvester and then the 2nd Trifuel war began.
